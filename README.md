# Vanilla Node CRUD 
Basic CRUD on the file system with vanilla Node.js and old-skool callback style

## What this Repo Has to Offer
This repo can help beginners understand the fundamentals of CRUD operations on the file system using Node.js

* As vanilla as possible to understand the brass tacks
* NO promises, `async` `await`
* Read, update, create, delete
* CommonJS syntax for exports, imports
* Pretty print json :)

## What you could do next

* Use ES6 with promises, `async` `await` to enhance code for more clarity: hint: `utils.promisify()` for version 8
* Add better error handling
* Add more customization to functions
